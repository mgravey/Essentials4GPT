title: "ðŸš€ One-Click & Double-Click Actions"

Streamline your workflow by assigning custom actions to single and double clicks. Pre-configure different models or settings for each click type, allowing you to instantly switch between your most-used configurations. You can also use "Temporary Chat" mode for either action to keep quick queries or experiments from cluttering your conversation history.
