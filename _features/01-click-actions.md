title: "🚀 One-Click & Double-Click Actions"
---
Streamline your workflow by assigning custom actions to single and double clicks. Pre-configure different models—such as the default `gpt-5-2` for simple clicks and `gpt-5-2-instant` for double clicks—allowing you to instantly switch between your most-used configurations. You can also use "Temporary Chat" mode for either action to keep quick queries or experiments from cluttering your conversation history.
